# UMSLHack2021: Fact Checker Chrome Extension

### Description
  Unsure about what you're reading? Highlight a few words, click on the extension, and then click Fact Check! This will display an overlay with a list of up to 10 related statements and their degree of truth. If these results don't work for you, this extension provides a short list of websites you can use to conduct further research. Clicking any of these links will automatically open a tab with a list of search results for your selection.
  
  For convenience, this extension also adds an extra item to your right-click context menu in Chrome. After highlighting your terms, simply right click on your highlighted text and click Fact Check from the menu that pops up.
  
  This Chrome Extension is written in Javascript, HTML, CSS and makes use of the Google Fact Check Tools API. Use of this extension is subject to Googleâ€™s API Terms of Service.

  3. Click on the "Developer mode" switch at the top right corner of the window.
  4. Click the "Load Unpacked" button at the top left corner of the window.

### Future Feature Wish List

  - Web server hosting that calls APIs, to reduce the strain on the client.
  - Web Server that does not rely on other APIs. Scrapes trusted sites and creates a database of trusted information.
  - Search predictions and autocomplete.
